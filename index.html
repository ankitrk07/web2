                <li>Origin and Birth of Lord Krishna:-</li>


        </b>
        <hr>
        <p>

            Krishna was born in Dvapara Yuga, which is considered the third of the four Yugas (ages in Hindu
            cosmology). His birth took place in Mathura, a city in northern India, to Vasudeva and Devaki. Devaki,
            however, was imprisoned by her brother Kamsa, the tyrannical king of Mathura. A prophecy foretold that
            Kamsa would be killed by Devaki’s eighth son, so he imprisoned the couple to prevent the birth.
            <br>

            Krishna's miraculous birth is one of the most famous episodes: On the night of his birth, the prison
            doors opened by themselves, and Vasudeva took the newborn Krishna across the Yamuna River to the village
            of Gokul. He exchanged Krishna with Yashoda, the wife of Nanda, and Krishna was raised as the foster son
            of Yashoda and Nanda in the pastoral community of Gokul.

            <hr>
            <p><big>Krishna's childhood is marked by divine miracles. As a child, he was known for his playful and
                    mischievous
                    nature. Some of the famous stories include : </big>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><big>Killing of Putana : </big> The Killing of Putana is one of the most famous and early miracles in
                the
                childhood of Krishna. Putana, a demoness sent by the wicked king Kamsa, disguised herself as a beautiful
                woman and entered Gokul where Krishna was living with his foster parents, Nanda and Yashoda. Her mission
                was to kill the infant Krishna by breastfeeding him with poisoned milk. However, Krishna, even as a
                baby, was no ordinary being. Recognizing Putana’s evil intentions, he sucked the very life force out of
                her instead of just drinking her milk. As he did so, Putana began to feel her strength draining away,
                and her body swelled to an enormous size. Realizing her doom, she tried to flee but collapsed and died,
                her body bloated and unrecognizable in her true demonic form. Krishna, by his divine power, protected
                the people of Gokul, and even though Putana was an enemy, some accounts suggest he granted her moksha
                (liberation) from the cycle of rebirth. This episode highlights Krishna’s divine nature, his ability to
                protect his devotees from evil, and his victory over the forces of darkness even as a child.</li>

            <br>
            <li><big>Killing of Trinavarta : </big>The Killing of Trinavarta is another powerful story from Krishna's
                childhood, showcasing his divine strength. Trinavarta, a fearsome demon sent by Kamsa to eliminate
                Krishna, took the form of a massive whirlwind to carry the infant Krishna away. The demon's plan was to
                throw Krishna to the ground from a great height, but Krishna, even as a baby, displayed his
                extraordinary divine power. As Trinavarta lifted Krishna high into the sky, Krishna grew heavier and
                heavier, causing the demon to struggle under the weight. In an unexpected turn, Krishna intensified his
                weight, and Trinavarta, unable to bear the pressure, crashed to the earth. The demon was instantly
                killed, and Krishna was safely returned to the ground. This event, like many others in Krishna's early
                life, demonstrated his invincible nature and his role as the protector of the innocent, further
                revealing his divine purpose of defeating evil and restoring cosmic order.

            <li><big>Lifting the Govardhan Parvat : </big>Lord Krishna, even as a young child, displayed immense divine
                power, as shown during the miraculous lifting of the Govardhan Hill. When the people of Vrindavan were
                preparing to perform a ritual to please Lord Indra, the god of rain, Krishna advised them to instead
                worship the Govardhan Hill, which provided them with everything they needed. This angered Indra, who
                sent a devastating storm to flood the region in revenge.

                In response, the young Krishna, with the strength of a deity, lifted the entire Govardhan Hill with just
                his little finger, holding it above his head like an umbrella. Despite his small size, Krishna supported
                the massive mountain effortlessly, sheltering the villagers and their cattle from the torrential
                downpour. For seven days and nights, Krishna stood unwavering, protecting them without tiring. His
                display of compassion and divine power not only saved the people of Vrindavan but also proved his
                supremacy over the forces of nature and the gods themselves. This act solidified Krishna as the
                protector of his devotees, and it is celebrated during the annual festival of Govardhan Puja.

            <li><big>Killing of Bakasura : </big>Killing of Bakasura – Story of Little Krishna

                One day, when little Krishna and his friends were grazing their cows near the forest in Vrindavan, a
                huge and terrifying demon named Bakasura appeared. He had taken the form of a giant crane (baka),
                sent by the evil King Kamsa to kill Krishna. With his massive beak and sharp eyes, Bakasura swooped down
                from the sky and attacked.

                The demon suddenly grabbed little Krishna with his beak and swallowed him whole! The cowherd boys were
                terrified and cried out, thinking Krishna was gone. But Krishna, calm and fearless even inside the
                demon, began to generate intense heat. Unable to bear it, Bakasura quickly spit him out.

                As soon as Krishna came out, he grabbed Bakasura's enormous beak with his tiny hands and tore it
                apart, splitting it in two. The demon let out a loud scream and died instantly. The gods in heaven
                rejoiced, and the cowherd boys cheered with relief and amazement.

                This event once again proved that Krishna, though just a small child, was no ordinary boy—he was divine
                and came to protect the world from evil.

            <li><big>Makhan Chor (Butter Thief) : </big>Little Krishna, lovingly known as Makhan Chor (the Butter
                Thief),
                was famous in the
                village of Vrindavan for his playful mischief and irresistible love for butter. Though Yashoda, his
                mother, tried to hide freshly churned butter in high places or locked pots, Krishna would always find
                clever ways to steal it—sometimes alone, sometimes with his group of friends. He would form human
                pyramids, break the hanging pots (handis), and share the butter with monkeys and his friends. The
                village women, though often annoyed, were secretly delighted by his innocent charm and mischief. His
                butter-stealing antics became legendary and symbolized the deep, loving bond between the divine and his
                devotees, as well as the joy and innocence of childhood.

                <big>Showing the Universe in His Mouth : </big>One of the most awe-inspiring miracles from little
                Krishna's childhood is the moment when he showed the entire universe in his mouth. One day, while
                playing with his friends, Krishna mischievously ate some mud. His friends ran to complain to his mother,
                Yashoda. Concerned, she asked Krishna if it was true, but he innocently denied it. To confirm, Yashoda
                asked him to open his mouth. As she looked inside, she was stunned—not by mud, but by a cosmic
                vision. Within his tiny mouth, she saw the entire universe: planets, stars, oceans, mountains, and
                even herself looking into his mouth. Overwhelmed with awe and confusion, Yashoda briefly realized that
                her child was no ordinary boy but the Supreme Being himself. However, by Krishna's divine will, she
                soon forgot the vision and continued to love and care for him as her playful little son. This miracle
                beautifully reveals the mystery of the divine hidden in the simplicity of childhood.

            <li><big>Stealing butter and playing with the gopis (milkmaids) : </big>
                Little Krishna’s playful mischief with the <big>gopis </big>(milkmaids) of Vrindavan is one of the most
                beloved
                parts of his childhood stories. He was especially famous for **stealing butter**, a treat he loved
                dearly. The gopis would hang their butter pots high from the ceiling to keep them safe, but Krishna,
                with his group of friends, would form human pyramids to reach them, break the pots, and share the butter
                with joy. Sometimes he even sneaked into homes silently, leaving tiny butter-smeared footprints behind.
                The gopis, though often pretending to be angry, were deeply charmed by his innocence and complained
                playfully to Mother Yashoda. Alongside this mischief, Krishna would also tease the gopis by hiding their
                clothes while they bathed in the river or playfully blocking their paths, all in good spirit. These
                sweet, divine games symbolized the deep love between Krishna and his devotees, full of joy, affection,
                and devotion.

            <li><big>Taming the Serpent Kaliya in a paragraph :
                </big>One of the most famous childhood miracles of Lord Krishna is the taming of the serpent Kaliya. The
                serpent had made his home in the Yamuna River, poisoning its waters and making it deadly for the people
                and animals of Vrindavan. When Krishna heard about this, he fearlessly jumped into the river to confront
                Kaliya. The mighty serpent coiled around him, but Krishna expanded his body and broke free. He then
                danced gracefully on Kaliya's multiple hoods, subduing him without killing him. Witnessing Krishna's
                divine form, Kaliya's wives pleaded for mercy, and the serpent finally surrendered. Krishna spared his
                life on the condition that he leave the river and never return. This miracle not only cleansed the
                Yamuna but also symbolized the victory of divine love and courage over evil and fear.

                <li>Divine Play (Leelas) flute :</li>

        </b>
        <hr>
        <p>One of the most enchanting aspects of <big>Krishna’s divine play (leelas)</big> was his flute
            playing. As a
            young boy in Vrindavan, Krishna would sit under a tree and play sweet, melodious tunes on his bansuri
            (flute). The music was so divine that birds stopped singing, rivers slowed their flow, and even
            animals gathered to listen. But most famously, his flute captivated the gopis (cowherd girls),
            especially <big>Radha</big>, who were drawn to him in a trance of love and devotion. This leela symbolizes
            the
            soul’s longing for union with the Divine. Through his flute, Krishna didn’t just make music — he called
            hearts toward spiritual love, reminding everyone of the joy of surrendering to God.
